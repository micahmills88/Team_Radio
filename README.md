# Team_Radio

A college project written entirely by me which processes samples from a software defined radio to output audio from radio station. The sample spectrum is displayed in the main gui, and station tuning is performed by selecting the signal of interest, tuning the radio directly, or scrolling through the stations with a mouse wheel.

A demonstration can be see at:
